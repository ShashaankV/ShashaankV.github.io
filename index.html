  <b>About me: </b>
  Data scientist and computational biologist. Trained in mathematical and computational biology at the NIH, 
  and prior medical training. Project lead and mentor on a number of projects. Prior to my focus on quantitative methods, 
  I worked in many wet labs (NIH, UCSF-Oncology, WRAIR, GWU-Chemistry, Genetics and IVF). 
  This experience with large molecular projects and complex clinical encounters motivated my pursuit of quantitative and nonlinear dynamics methods.  
  My interests are generative modeling at multiple levels of description (statistical, physical, mechanistic), applied math, and building data products.
  I am interested in new collaborative opportunities along these lines.

    <b>About cittatech: </b>
  My pet project is modeling cognition and devising measurement tools for tracking "states-of-mind" (Sanskrit - citta).
  I made a smartphone tool for this and working with mobile EEGs to optimize this system.
  I was fortunate to be a speaker on this at IPAM, NIMH, and SIAM LS. (Thank you to my colleagues.) 
  Goal: cittatech.org as landing page for past and future work for these tools (in-progress)
