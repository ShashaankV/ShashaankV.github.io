  <b>About me: </b>
  Data scientist and computational biologist. Trained in mathematical and computational biology at the NIH, 
  with medical training prior to the NIH. Project lead and mentor on a number of projects. Prior to my focus on quantitative methods, 
  I worked in many wet labs (NIH, UCSF-Oncology, WRAIR, GWU-Chemistry, Genetics and IVF). 
  This experience with (often large) molecular projects and complex clinical encounters motivated my pursuit of quantitative and nonlinear dynamics methods.  
  My interests are generative modeling at multiple levels of description (statistical, physical, mechanistic), applied math, and building data products.
  I am interested in new collaborative opportunities along these lines.

    <b>About cittatech: </b>
  My pet project is modeling cognition and devising measurement tools for tracking, predicting, altering "states-of-mind" (Sanskrit - citta). 
  My motivation is both intellectual and clinical. 
  Inspired by my time at Kennedy Krieger and the NIH, I believe there are no extant cognitive measurement tools with a sound biological basis. 
  I, with my colleagues, am working to change that.
  I have been fortunate to speak on this work at IPAM, NIMH, and SIAM LS. (Thank you to my colleagues for these opportunities.) I have several papers on the biophysical basis. 
  Regarding applications, I made a smartphone tool for this that is in R&D including the integration of mobile EEG. 
  (Contact me if we share a common interest. Particularly interested in funding opportunities.)

  (More to come on these tools...)
