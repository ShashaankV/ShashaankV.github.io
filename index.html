  <b>About: </b>
  After medical school, I was fortunate to be an apprentice in mathematical and computational modeling at the NIH. 
  I am independent now, though continue to collaborate with the NIH and others.
  I am interested in new opportunities. 
  My interests are generative modeling at multiple levels of description (statistical, physical, mechanistic), applied math, and building data products.   
  <P>
  My pet project is modeling cognition and devising measurement tools for tracking "states-of-mind" (Sanskrit - citta).
  I made a smartphone tool for this and working with mobile EEGs to optimize this system.
  I was fortunate to be a speaker on this at IPAM, NIMH, and SIAM LS. (Thank you to my colleagues.) 
  Goal: cittatech.org as landing page for past and future work for these tools (in-progress)
  <P>
  I did a bit of work on genomic analysis methods at the NIH (part of Plink2, extended by major labs and the startup Genomic Prediction).
  <P>
    I was fortunate to work with great teams on Bayesian COVID pandemic modeling, and Bayesian Medicare claims analyses.
  <P>
    I am interested in modeling and coding in general. I gave some didactic talks (for my own edification) in finance (MPT) and causal modeling (on Judea Pearl), 
  and worked on a short IMF-World Economic Outlook challenge.
