  <b>About me: </b>
  Data scientist and computational biologist. Trained in mathematical and computational biology at the NIH, 
  with medical training prior to the NIH. Project lead and mentor on a number of projects. Prior to my focus on quantitative methods, 
  I worked in many wet labs (NIH, UCSF-Oncology, WRAIR, GWU-Chemistry, Genetics and IVF). 
  This experience with (often large) molecular projects and complex clinical encounters motivated my pursuit of quantitative and nonlinear dynamics methods.  
  My interests are generative modeling at multiple levels of description (statistical, physical/mechanistic), applied math, and building data products.
  I am interested in new collaborative opportunities along these lines.

    <b>About cittatech: </b>
  My pet project is modeling cognition and devising measurement tools for tracking, predicting, altering "states-of-mind" (Sanskrit - citta). 
  I am influenced by my time at Kennedy Krieger and the NIH. 
  My motivations are both intellectual and driven by clinical necessity.  
  Current measures are based on a boxology-type concept models with loose connections to biological mechanisms. 
  I believe there are no extant cognitive measurement tools with a sound biological basis.  
  <p>
  Why is this a problem? Cognition (and its impairment) is based in biology. 
  A poor map to these factors limits our predictive and therapeutic abilities.
  Often I sit in meetings where there are complaints about biomarkers for mental health.
  Typically the approach taken is collecting more data and building devices with higher-resolution.
  How to interpret this data is given far less attention (and funding). 
 Addressing fundamentals such as the underlying biophysics, and latent variable modeling (making the unobservable, measurable) is important and useful.
 Such as, accounting for nonlinearities in measures and how these come about.
  <p>
  I, with my colleagues, am working to change this. 
  Our approach respects the physics of the brain during information processing. 
  I have been fortunate to speak about this work at IPAM, NIMH, and SIAM LS. (Thank you to my colleagues for these opportunities.) I have several papers on the biophysical basis. 
  Validating this approach requires special stimulus conditions. 
  We created a smartphone tool that is in R&D, including integration with mobile EEG.
